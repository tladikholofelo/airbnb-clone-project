A well-designed interface reduces friction during the booking journey, leading to higher user satisfaction, fewer abandoned bookings, and ultimately, more successful transactions. Key design principles such as clear navigation, easy-to-understand calls to action, and accessible content contribute to building trust with users and enhancing their overall experience.
